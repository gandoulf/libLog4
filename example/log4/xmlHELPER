If no date format specifier is given then the following format is used: "Wed Jan 02 02:03:55 1980". The date format specifier admits the same syntax as the ANSI C function strftime, with 1 addition. The addition is the specifier %l for milliseconds, padded with zeros to make 3 digits.

%p - the priority
%r - milliseconds since this layout was created.
%R - seconds since Jan 1, 1970
%u - clock ticks since process start
%x - the NDC
%t - thread name
